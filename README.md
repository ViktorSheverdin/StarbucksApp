This is a simple copy of Starbucks application with some of the basic functionality - search based on name of the city or town,
saving favourite cafe, rating them, selecting each individual cafe, as well as sending a list of your favourite location so you can share with friends.
Application uses REST API (Google Maps, Google locations, AWS RDP, as the application is working with SQL database),
